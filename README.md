# simple lynx webapp template you can use to set up your own lynx website/webapp structure

used ./templates/, ./views/ just to borrow some terminology from ruby/rails, but you don't have to stick to any specific organization/directory scheme to use lynx/lune/etc.
obviously this is not a full website framework with database access and stuff (but you can definitely write your own https wrappers or just save stuff to json!) and I'm not exactly sure how to set up routing
to actually host this on a real domain, but this should be enough to show that you can indeed write a little website in Luau, pretty easily :)
